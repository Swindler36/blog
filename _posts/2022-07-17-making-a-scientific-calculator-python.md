# Making A Scientific Calculator With Python

Hi guys. Welcome to my blog. This post is first devlog for my scientific calculator.

## Motivation Of Project

I am an engineer and I want to define in the calculator I used on my paper. I want to define functions in calculator and manipulate it in my equation. So, I decided to make my calculator.

## Project Stack

* Python
* Tkinter
* numexpr
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* dbBuilder.py (my sqlite3 library)
* SymPy

## GUI

**Function Definition**

## Calculation

**Equation Evulation**
I am using numexpr to evaluate equations from string equation. Also, I will create a syntax with this library. I am planing to create new calculator instance for evaluating each function.
In the future of the development, more details about the project will be clear. 

See you in next devlogs...
