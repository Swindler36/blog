            "content": "Making A Scientific Calculator With Python . Hi guys. Welcome to my blog. This post is first devlog for my scientific calculator. . Motivation Of Project . I am an engineer and I want to define in the calculator I used on my paper. I want to define functions in calculator and manipulate it in my equation. So, I decided to make my calculator. . Project Stack . Python | Tkinter | numexpr | NumPy | Matplotlib | Pandas | dbBuilder.py (my sqlite3 library) | SymPy | . . GUI . Function Definition . . Calculation . Equation Evulation I am using numexpr to evaluate equations from string equation. Also, I will create a syntax with this library. I am planing to create new calculator instance for evaluating each function. In the future of the development, more details about the project will be clear. . See you in next devlogs… .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .
